The cosmetic company “BeautifyMe” has decided to reward its brand promoters with a batch of cosmetics. Each batch is identified by a unique numeric barcode. Each digit of the barcode number represents a product ID of the products present in the batch. Before distributing the products to its promoters, the company wants to make sure that all products present in the batch are still fresh and safe to use.
